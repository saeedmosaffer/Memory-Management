# Memory-Management
Simulates MVT (Multiprogramming with Variable Tasks) memory management. Manages 2 GB memory (512 MB for OS), allocating processes from ready.txt and loading jobs from job.txt as others finish. Tracks processes with a PCB table and performs compaction when needed. Outputs memory diagrams and queue statuses.
